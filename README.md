# M2 Internship Supplementary

Supplementary Materials to reproduce figures appearing on my M2 Internship Report

**TODO**:

* Add link to poetry to reproduce virtualenv

* Add link to STREAM

* Add datasets in a release

* Add minimal examples (or link to scBoolSeq-Supplementary)

* Add explanation on how to import the module (rename `bn_synthesis0` to `bn_synthesis`)
    * Do this after copying the latest version from the dev. dir.
